                    <p>2020 - 2023</p>
                    <p>
                        Having demonstrated success in assisting members in our inbound role, 
                        I accepted the role of Client Concierge Specialist. In this role, we take on tasks for our 
                        clients to make proactive outbound calls to let members know of any potentially upcoming 
                        negative impacts to their prescription drug coverage. This included but 
                        was not limited to letting them know of changes in their copay at certain points in the year with Medicare,  
                        letting them know if their drug was not covered, and their rights they have to request a 
                        coverage exception, and also letting members know of any coverage determinations that may have 
                        not been able to be approved, and their rights to appeal.
                        In this role the company made profit based on volume of calls made by the team. 
                        We were gauged based on our calls per hour, I routinely hit 9 per hour which was considered exceeding goal.
